            <h1>What is a PCR Test?</h1>
            <p>
                A PCR <i>(polymerase chain reaction)</i> test is a 
                lab technique that our healthcare providers at Boynton use
                to test for infectious or genetic diseases. 
                You may have had a PCR test done in the past if you 
                received a nasal swab test for COVID-19 or influenza.
            </p>
            <h1>How does a PCR test work?</h1>
            <p>
                After taking a swab from a body site (such as deep in your nose), 
                our doctors at Boynton will use PCR to make many copies of the 
                DNA (known as amplification) that was in the original sample. 
                This amplification allows your doctor to better analyze 
                the DNA and identify a very specific sequence of molecules that's unique
                to the DNA it's looking for (target DNA).
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                For example, your doctor could find a sequence of
                molecules that could be the genetic code of a virus or 
                bacteria. In testing for infectious diseases, like viruses, 
                the solution has labels that allow the doctor to see whether 
                the sample is positive or negative for the target DNA.
            </blockquote>
            <h1>Getting Tested: What does it look like?</h1>
            
                <p>The lab technician will take a sample of mucus from <a href=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22878-nasopharyngeal-swab>(a sample from far back in your nasal cavity)</a>  to look for common 
                infections like <i>influenza</i> <a href=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4335-influenza-flu>(the flu)</a>, COVID-19, or
                <i>respiratory syncytial virus</i> <a href=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/rsv-respiratory-syncytial-virus>(RSV)</a>. See figure 1 for how 
                this may look.</p>

                <p>Boynton will notify you ahead of time if there
                is anything you must do to prepare for the test, but most 
                often there is no preparation needed to take a PCR test.</p> 

            <h1>Results and Follow-Up</h1>
            <p>
                The results of nasal swab tests for common viruses like the flu
                and COVID-19 usually take about a day to come back.
            </p>
            <p>
                A positive PCR test <em>("detected")</em>  results means that it is likely that 
                you have the virus that you were tested for, or you recently recovered from it. 
                You should
                plan to miss classes and other in-person activities for the 
                next few days to limit the spread of the virus.
            </p>
            <p>
                A negative PCR test <em>("not detected")</em> means you probably 
                don't have a virus at the time of your nasal swab. You may still 
                have an infection or virus, but you were tested too 
                early and it wasn't detectable at the time of the PCR test. 
                If you still have symptoms a few days after getting a PCR test
                you should consider coming back into Boynton and getting tested again.
